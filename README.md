# Custom-Search-and-Sort-Bar-javascript
Creating Custom Search and Sort Bar using simple Javasript syntax 

The point here is the ability to make the user always entering the proper data without giving a chance for un proper data,

to be passed to your code logic, the sorting part is optional and i am using it in java with the servlet.
                 
By choosing the search option you will have the ability to change the search input field depends on the search option.
              
This is just design and javascript control of the input field behaviour depends on the search option, the logic behind the scene

it is up to you to implement it depends on the back end language that you are using.
